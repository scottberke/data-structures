# Practice Problems - Stacks

## Sort Stack
Q) Write a program to sort a stack such that the smallest items are on the top. You can use an additional temporary stack, but you may not copy the elements into any other data structure (like an array). The stack supports the following operations: push, pop, peek, is_empty.

## Towers Of Hanoi
Q) In the classic problem of the towers of hanoi, you have 3 towers and N discs of different sizes which can slide onto any tower. The puzzle starts with disks sorted in ascending order of size from top to bottom (ie. each disk sits on top of an even larger one). You have the following constraings:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time
2) A disk is slid off the top of one tower onto another tower
3) A disk can not be placed on top of a smaller disk
Write a program to move the disks from the first tower to the last tower using stacks.
