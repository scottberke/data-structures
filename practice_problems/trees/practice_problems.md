# Practice Problems - Trees

## Minimal Tree
Q) Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

- Test Case: [Check Permutations](../../test/practice_problem_tests/trees/minimal_tree_test.py)
- Solution: [Check Permutations](./minimal_tree.py)

## List Of Depths
Q) Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth. (ie if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists)

- Test Case: [Check Permutations](../../test/practice_problem_tests/trees/list_of_depths_test.py)
- Solution: [Check Permutations](./list_of_depths.py)
