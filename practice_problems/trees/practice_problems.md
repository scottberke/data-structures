# Practice Problems - Trees

## Minimal Tree
Q) Given a sorted (increasing order) array with unique integer elements, write an algorithm to create a binary search tree with minimal height.

- Test Case: [Minimal Tree](../../test/practice_problem_tests/trees/minimal_tree_test.py)
- Solution: [Minimal Tree](./minimal_tree.py)

## List Of Depths
Q) Given a binary tree, design an algorithm which creates a linked list of all the nodes at each depth. (ie if you have a tree with depth D, you'll have D linked lists)

- Test Case: [List Of Depths](../../test/practice_problem_tests/trees/list_of_depths_test.py)
- Solution: [List Of Depths](./list_of_depths.py)


## Check Balanced
Q) Implement a function to check if a binary tree is balanced. For the purposes of this question, a balanced tree is defined to be a tree such that the heights of the two subtrees of any node never differ by more than one.

- Solution: [Check Balanced](./check_balanced.py)
