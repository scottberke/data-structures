## Primitive Data Types
Primitive data types are data types provided as a basic building block in a language. These can be though of as ‘basic data types’ such as integers, booleans, floating point numbers, characters, strings.  Composite data types are built using primitive data types. Understanding memory (RAM), bits and bytes provides a good foundation for understanding primitives:
- [Bits and Bytes](./primitives/bits-bytes-binary-memory.md#bits-and-bytes)
- [Binary](./primitives/bits-bytes-binary-memory.md#binary)
- [Memory](./primitives/bits-bytes-binary-memory.md#memory)

- [Integers](./primitives/primitives.md#integers)
- [Floating Point Numbers](./primitives/primitives.md#floating-point-numbers)
- [Characters](./primitives/primitives.md#characters)
- [Booleans](./primitives/primitives.md#booleans)
- [Pointers](./primitives/primitives.md#pointers)
